            Lakers had Kobe, we’ve got “Bobe”. Bobe’s work ethic is unmatched and
            is the example by which all of us should follow. We have a generational
            opportunity to build a game changing sports media company, so we should
            pursue our mission until we have nothing left to give and feel confident
            that, if we do this, all our hard work will be worth the effort.
